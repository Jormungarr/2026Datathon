## Airline Fare Market Structure Analysis

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Airfare prices in the U.S. domestic market are shaped by a complex interaction of demand, distance, competition intensity, and market concentration.  

While route distance and passenger volume are intuitive drivers of ticket prices, structural factors such as hub dominance, carrier market share, and city-level demand strength may systematically influence airfare variation across markets.

Using the U.S. Department of Transportation Domestic Airline Consumer Airfare dataset (2021–2025 Q2), this project investigates the structural determinants of route-level fare differences and develops predictive models to explain and forecast airfare dynamics.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify key structural drivers of airfare variation  
- Reduce multicollinearity using PCA  
- Compare interpretable statistical models with network-based models  
- Generate actionable insights into market structure and pricing dynamics

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Distribution analysis of fares  
- Market share and competition patterns  
- Construction of city-level demand indicators (e.g., *City Strength*)

### 2️⃣ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

To summarize correlated market structure variables:

- **PC1:** Overall market scale and competitiveness  
- **PC2:** Route structure and hub dominance  
- **PC3:** Traffic intensity and asymmetry  

The first three principal components explain approximately **74% of total variance**.

### 3️⃣ Modeling Approaches

#### Lasso Regression (Baseline)
- Handles multicollinearity  
- Performs automatic variable selection  
- Cross-validated regularization parameter  

#### Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
- Captures nonlinear relationships  
- Maintains interpretability  

#### Graph Neural Network (GNN)
- Models airline markets as a graph  
- Captures structural dependencies between cities  
- Incorporates network topology into fare prediction
